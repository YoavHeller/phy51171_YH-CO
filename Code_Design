Code Structure

The code is structured into these modules:
Production, analysis and design.

Production

Use- runs the simulation.

Classes
	
class Particle-
Represents individual particles in the simulation
Attributes-  position, velocity, charge and mass.
functions
update_particle_positions(): Updates particle positions based on their velocities.
update_particle_velocities(): Updates velocitites for given field.

class Field-
Represents the electric field in 1D
input- range and num of grid points
Attributes- dx grid size, grid_pos array of positions of the grid points, num of cells, field, frequencies and FFT of field
Functions:
compute_density()- takes particles and calculated their density in the grid points in different methods
density_field- calculates the electric field from the density

class PicSimulation-
Core class that sets up and manages the simulation parameters (e.g., number of particles, time step) and advances the simulation in time.
Also could store the data over time.
Attributes- particle array, the field grid, current and saved data.
takes as input the data you wanna save: position, velocity, potential (and FFT), field (and FFT).

Functions
initialize_particles()- arrays of positions and velocities into an array of particles
initialize_half_velocity- calculates the velocoties at t=-dt/2
update_particles
update field- calculatesfield from particles
update_velocities
time step- updates positions, update feild, update velocities and saves (?)



Main Loop
A `run_simulation()` function or a method in `PICSimulation` that iterates through time steps, saving relevant data (like particle positions and electric fields) for analysis and visualisation.



 2. Analysis

Classes
DataProcessor
 Class to handle the raw simulation data from the PicSimulation and compute quantities like kinetic energy, potential energy, and momentum. 

Functions
Any calculation for data we’d like to extrapolate: energy, momentum, FFT.
“The dynamics of phase or velocity or distribution function space may be of interest in which case a movie might be made, probably from snapshots every dt or 2*dt”
export_data()
Saves processed data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) for further use.


3. Visualization
Classes
Visualizer
 A class that reads processed data and provides plotting capabilities.

Functions
Any visualisation we’d like to create. For example:    
plot_density_profile()
Plots the density profile over time or at a specific time step.
plot_field_profile()
Plots the electric field distribution at a specific time step.
plot_energy_vs_time()
 Plots kinetic and potential energy as a function of time to check energy conservation.
animate_particles()
Generates an animation showing particle positions over time.

Main script
     - Import the `simulation`, `analysis`, and `visualization` modules.
     - Create an instance of `PICSimulation` specifying the initial and parameters, aswell as the required data. call `run_simulation()` to generate data.
     - Pass the output data to `DataProcessor` for analysis.
     - Use `Visualizer` to visualize and animate the results.
