**Project** 
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) Simulations of the Two-Stream Instability

**Description** 
This project simulates a one-dimensional electrostatic system using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method. 

**Usage**

**Directory structure**
- design
  * Contains a notebook that was used to organize the main pieces of the simulation.

- production
  * ising2d.py: Contains the main Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising Model.
compute_observables.py: Uses the library ising2d.py to compute physical observables.

- analysis
  * Contains a notebook that computes the kinetic energy and momentum. 

- Visualization
  * The computed observables are stored in files here.

- figures
  * Contains the figures for the report.

- report
  * Contains the project report.
